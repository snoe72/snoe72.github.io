								<h3>Education</h3>
 							        <ul>
  								<li><strong>Ph.D. Anthropology</strong>, University of California, Santa Barbara (expected 2025)</li>
  								<li><strong>M.A. Applied Anthropology</strong>, University of Maryland</li>
   								<li><strong>B.A. Anthropology</strong>, Mercyhurst University</li>
   								</ul>

								<h3>Research Interests</h3>
  									<p> I study human-environment interactions with a focus on subsistence strategies, animal domestication, and risk mitigation in the face of environmental and social change. My research explores how ancient
      								    societies adapted to shifting ecologies, developed food systems, and maintained cooperation and resilience in times of stress.
   									</p>

								<h3>Methods Expertise</h3>
    								<p> I apply stable isotope analysis, ancient DNA (aDNA), zooarchaeology, and radiocarbon dating to
   								    reconstruct past diets, mobility patterns, and human-animal relationships. My work integrates
     								    archaeological and scientific datasets to investigate domestication, hunting intensification, and
     								    pastoral transitions. I also use statistical and computational tools, including <strong>R</strong>,
    								    <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>MATLAB</strong>, for quantitative analysis, data visualization,
    								    and ecological modeling.
   							         </p>

								 <h3>Regional Expertise</h3>
  							         <p>  My research centers on the Central Andes, with additional work in the North American Midwest,
     								      particularly Mississippian mound sites.

  								<h3>Camelid Domestication and Early Management in the Lake Titicaca Basin</h3>
  								<p>
  									This project investigates the transition from hunting to early management of camelids during the Archaic Period in the Lake Titicaca Basin using faunal analysis, stable isotope data, ancient mitochondrial DNA, and radiocarbon dating. Located in the high-altitude Altiplano of southern Peru, this region experienced significant ecological shifts during the Holocene, including Archaic-period lake regression and increasing aridity, which likely influenced subsistence strategies.
  									Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen reveals a gradual shift in camelid dietary and mobility patterns over time, consistent with low-level management practices prior to full domestication. These data indicate that humans began exerting control over camelid foraging behavior well before clear archaeological evidence of herding.
  									Ancient DNA analysis of camelid remains dating as early as the mid-Holocene shows high genetic diversity relative to modern populations, providing some of the oldest genetic data for South American camelids. This genetic diversity suggests that a domestication bottleneck had not yet occurred and supports the interpretation of incipient management rather than intensive breeding.
  								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Risk, Climate, and Subsistence: Comparative Faunal Analysis of Mississippian Societies</h3>
								<p>
  									This project investigates how Mississippian communities in the American Bottom and Central Illinois River Valley (CIRV) adapted their subsistence strategies in response to climate fluctuations, population growth, and sociopolitical instability between the 11th and 14th centuries CE. Faunal assemblages from Cahokia—North America’s largest pre-Columbian urban center—and outlying CIRV settlements are analyzed to assess how local ecological risk, social organization, and conflict shaped animal exploitation patterns.
									The study focuses on the impacts of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), a period of regional warming and aridity, on maize agricultural productivity and dietary diversification. At Cahokia, evidence suggests increased reliance on high-risk, high-return hunting strategies, consistent with centralized redistribution systems supporting a dense urban population. In contrast, CIRV communities exhibit broader-spectrum foraging and risk-buffering behaviors, likely reflecting decentralized food production and concerns over raiding and intergroup violence.
									By comparing taxonomic diversity, age profiles, and skeletal part representation, the research identifies divergent risk management strategies linked to settlement hierarchy and demographic pressure. These findings contribute to broader models of resilience and collapse in prehistoric complex societies.

								<h3>Climate Change, Food Insecurity, and Violence in the Andean Highlands</h3>
								<p>
								   	This research investigates how climate change influenced food systems, subsistence stress, and patterns of conflict in the prehispanic Andes. Drawing on paleoclimate data, isotopic evidence, and regional archaeological surveys, we examine how shifting ecological conditions shaped both environmental risk and human behavioral responses across time.
								   In particular, the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000–1450) presents a case of widespread climate instability, including declining rainfall, shrinking lakes, and cooler temperatures. These changes disrupted agricultural productivity and pastoral systems, contributing to food insecurity and population shifts. Stable isotope analysis of human remains reveals elevated δ¹⁵N values consistent with chronic undernourishment, while site abandonment and defensive architecture suggest rising regional tensions.

								<h3>Comparative Osteometry for Species Identification and Colonial Faunal Histories</h3>
								<p>
									This project collects standardized osteometric data from modern comparative specimens of dogs, rabbits, and cattle to enhance zooarchaeological research across the Americas. Dog measurements refine criteria for distinguishing domesticated dogs from wild canids such as wolves and coyotes, improving interpretations of early human–canid relationships. Rabbit skeletal data support the development of an improved leporid metapodial index, facilitating taxonomic differentiation and analysis of processing intensity. 
									Cattle measurements contribute to the study of livestock introduced during the 
									Spanish colonial period, enabling assessments of breed origins, morphological variation, 
									and management strategies in early colonial assemblages. Together, these datasets provide essential morphometric 
									baselines for identifying species, understanding domestication, and reconstructing human–animal interactions across time and space.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3>Historic Foodways in California</h3>
								<p>
									This study applies zooarchaeological methods to analyze faunal remains recovered from refuse deposits at Mission Santa Clara (1777–1836), a key site in the Spanish colonial network of Alta California. The research investigates food procurement, preparation, and consumption strategies with a focus on butchery and bone fragmentation patterns. High frequencies of long bone shaft fragmentation, spiral fractures, and extensive grease-rendering indicators point to intensive secondary processing practices such as marrow and grease extraction—techniques associated with both nutritional optimization and traditional culinary knowledge.
									Taxonomic abundance data indicate a provisioning system centered on domesticated cattle, while the absence of high-value skeletal portions and presence of low-utility elements suggest institutionalized distribution systems that prioritized meat allocation based on status or role. These data, combined with taphonomic indicators, provide insight into how colonial systems structured food access and how traditional food processing methods persisted within them. This analysis contributes to broader discussions of colonial provisioning, resource management, and food system adaptation in frontier mission settings.
